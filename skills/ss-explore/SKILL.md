  Use when starting work on a feature or bug fix to understand the codebase before
  proposing changes, when asked to "explore the code", "understand the problem",
  "find related code", or "check for existing implementations". Produces a structured
  summary of what exists, what needs to change, and key risks.

# Explore

## Overview

Structured codebase exploration before design. Understand the problem space, existing code, and prior art before proposing any changes.

## Process

### Step 1: Read the issue

Read the full issue body. Extract:

- Objective — what is the desired end state?
- Constraints — what must not change?
- Acceptance signals — how do we know it works?
- Non-goals — what is explicitly out of scope?

### Step 2: Check for existing implementations

Before proposing new code, search for prior art within the codebase:

```
Grep for related function names, types, and concepts.
```

Existing partial implementations change the design. A function that already does 80% of what you need is not a greenfield task — it is an extension.

### Step 3: Fan-out exploration

Use this tool priority (fastest first):

1. **Local filesystem** — Glob, Grep, Read for file patterns and code search
2. **Semantic search** — DeepWiki MCP or LSP for understanding dependency relationships
3. **Web** — WebFetch/WebSearch for external API docs or prior art

### Step 4: Find all consumers of shared interfaces

When the change touches a shared function, type, or interface:

```
Grep for all import sites and call sites.
```

Every consumer must be understood before design begins. A change to a shared interface with 3 consumers is a different problem than one with 30.

### Step 5: Check for duplicates

Search open and recently closed issues/PRs for related work. Avoid duplicating effort.

### Step 6: Produce summary

Output a structured summary to conversation context (not a file):

- **What exists** — relevant code, partial implementations, related utilities
- **What needs to change** — files to modify, new files needed
- **All consumers** — every call site of shared interfaces being modified
- **Key decisions** — design choices that need resolution
- **Risks** — backward compatibility, performance, blast radius

## Hard Gates

- Must understand existing code before proposing changes
- Must check for duplicate/related issues
- Must find all consumers of any shared interface being modified

## Resumability

Before re-exploring, check what is already in conversation context. Do not repeat work that has already been done in this session.
