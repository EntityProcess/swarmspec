# Ship

## Overview

Complete the development branch and integrate the work. Final verification gate, PR management, merge, and worktree cleanup.

## Hard Gate

Must have passing verification evidence from ss-verify before shipping. If no verification has been done in this session, stop and tell the user to run ss-verify first.

## Process

### Step 1: Final verification gate

Run the full check chain one last time:

```bash
bun run build && bun run test && bun run lint
```

All must pass with output as evidence. Do not skip this even if ss-verify ran recently — code may have changed since.

### Step 2: Final blast radius check

Before marking the PR ready, grep for the primary types and functions changed in this PR across the entire codebase:

```bash
git diff main...HEAD --name-only  # Files changed in this PR
# For each modified shared type/function:
grep -r "TypeName\|functionName" --include="*.ts" .
```

Any consumer not touched by this PR is a potential miss. This is the last line of defense.

### Step 3: Push and mark ready

```bash
git push
gh pr ready <number>
```

### Step 4: Risk classification

Assess the PR for merge risk:

| Auto-merge (low risk) | Confirm before merge (elevated risk) |
|---|---|
| Documentation changes | Breaking API changes |
| Config file updates | Feature deletion |
| Additive features (new files only) | Schema or data model changes |
| Isolated bug fixes | Security-sensitive changes |
| Style/formatting | Cross-repo coordination |
| Test additions | Changes to shared types with many consumers |

### Step 5: Merge

For auto-merge candidates, squash merge:

```bash
gh pr merge <number> --squash
```

For elevated risk, present the risk assessment and wait for explicit user confirmation before merging.

### Step 6: Worktree cleanup

After merge:

```bash
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
cd <main-worktree>
git pull origin main
```

### Step 7: Close tracking

- Verify the linked issue was closed by the merge
- For multi-repo work: link related PRs, update tracking issues

## Cross-Repo Work

For changes spanning multiple repositories, follow the coordination instructions in the repo's CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md. The plugin's additions:

- Link related PRs across repos in PR descriptions
- Cross-repo PRs require explicit user confirmation before merging
- Update tracking issues with links to all related PRs
